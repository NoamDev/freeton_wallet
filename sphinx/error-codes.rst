FreeTON Error codes
===================

It is often useful to have the mapping between error codes and the
corresponding errors. Here are a few useful links:

* https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/3874d1-error-codes/b/82f8c1

* https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_client.md#clienterrorcode

* https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler/blob/master/API.md#solidity-runtime-errors

Additionnally, other non documented codes are:

* `result_code = 37`: not enough value to transfer with the message
